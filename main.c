// for most homework in this class, we will
// write the function signatures and documentation.
// In this assignment, you can do so yourself.
// Documentation for each function can be limited to
// a very brief description of the function's purpose.

// Your main program should go here. The main program
// should call your functions and execute the guessing game according to our
// stated requirements.
