Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu to complete and test your work. The reason is that this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

Important notes

    Your code must compile and run on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.

## Thinking exercises to complete
1. In the worse case, how many guesses would it our guessing game take to get the right answer if we had no hints at all? Explain.

2. In the worst case, how many guesses does it take to get the right number if we get a hint of "higher or lower" when guessing numbers 1-10 and guess intelligently (always picking in the middle of the remaining set of numbers)? Is there a mathematical expression that we could use to explain the relationship between the number of possible numbers to guess and the number of guesses required? 

3. Which algorithm are we running here if we guess intelligently, using the higher and lower hints? Which algorithm are we running if we have no hints?
